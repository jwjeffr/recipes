### Ingredients:

---

- Chicken
    - Any cut works! This is a slow-cooked meal, so anything will be tender
    - This is the only ingredient that can't be vegan, so feel free to substitute this for something else to make it vegan! Just be sure that whatever substitute you have will survive in a slow cooker. Or, if won't survive, cook it separately!
- Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
    - My go-to's are [this brand](https://www.amazon.com/Costena-Chipotle-Peppers-Ounce-Pack/dp/B00HF7VVU4/ref=asc_df_B00HF7VVU4)
- Tomatoes in sauce
    - Canned San Marzano tomatoes are my go-to, or anything similar. I find that you can really taste the difference between high-quality and cheap tomatoes in this dish
- White onion(s)
    - These will end up being diced, so feel free to buy them pre-diced.
- Minced garlic
    - If you prefer the taste of fresh garlic, feel free to mince garlic yourself! Or buy it canned, no shame here :)
- Mexican oregano
    - This one is a bit hard to find in my experience, so I usually just use an Italian seasoning blend instead. But, if you can find this, use it!
- Fresh cilantro
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Ramen noodles
    - Any of your choice! I love the cheap packets.
- Stock
    - Some sort of cooking stock. Chicken broth is the best option in my opinion. I usually just microwave water and stir around a chicken bouillon cube. You can also make a stock out of the seasoning packet that comes with your ramen noodles, but be careful to not use the whole packet - your dish will be **very** salty if you do.
- MSG (Optional)
    - I put MSG, aka Make Shit Good, in pretty much every savory dish I make. You can leave this out if you want
- Sliced avocado (Optional)
    - Good for garnishing. I'm allergic to it, so I always leave it out
- Jalapeno (Optional)
    - For garish
- Red onion (Optional)
    - Also for garnish
- Lime wedges (Optional)
    - Last garnish!

### Instructions:

---

1. If your chicken has skin on it, remove it. Set it aside - you won't need it for this recipe. You can air fry them to make delicious chips!

2. Dice your white onion(s)

3. Optionally saute the minced garlic and white onion. This does add some flavor, but not a whole lot relative to the chipotle peppers, so feel free to skip this step if you don't want to use another dish.

4. Put your tomatoes, chicken, chipotle peppers, garlic, and onion in your slow cooker. Optionally break off your cilantro stems and put the stems in. The fibrous texture that a lot of people don't like becomes less chalky when they're slow-cooked, in my opinion. All of these amounts are to your heart's desire, but I usually use one 7-oz can of chipotle peppers per 3 chicken thighs. Just remember that the tomatoes and chipotle peppers should be the star of the show :)

6. Season the mixture with MSG, oregano, and a little bit of olive oil.

7. Set aside, and cook on a low-heat for at least 4 hours. The longer this cooks, the better, but the acidity in the adobo sauce can give the chicken a weird texture if you cook it for way too long. This probably shouldn't be cooking for more than 8 hours. Halfway through cooking, or once the chicken is fork-tender, shred the chicken, and remove the bones if necessary.

8. Right before the chicken is done cooking, cook your ramen noodles in your stock. You should ideally slightly undercook them, since they'll cook a bit in the chicken/sauce mixture.

9. Once the chicken is done, shut off the slow cooker and thoroughly stir the chicken and sauce together. Let this cool down a little bit, at least until it stops boiling.

10. Place the noodles in the pot, and add stock until the chicken/sauce mixture reaches a consistency you like. Remember, you can always add, but not remove.

11. Serve in bowls, putting your garnishes (avocado, jalapeno, red onion, and lime wedges) on top, and enjoy! This is best served with Corona Light beer, in my opinion. I personally have a cilantro addiction, so feel free to go easier on the cilantro than I did.

12. Enjoy! Be careful, this is a spicy dish! If you don't have the best spice tolerance, consider pairing this with something creamy like horchata.+++
